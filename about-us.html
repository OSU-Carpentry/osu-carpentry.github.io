<p>Welcome to the OSU Carpentry Organization! We are a group of faculty, staff, and students who organize and teach free workshops based on the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a> organizationsâ€™ learning materials. We are actively engaged in enhancing the productivity of research <em>across all disciplines</em> on campus.</p>

<p>Our workshops help researchers and students improve the quality and efficiency of their work by teaching them how to use open-source software tools and computing resources. These workshops engage participants through  a combination of theory and hands-on experience. Click on the workshop links to learn more and register for our workshops!</p>
